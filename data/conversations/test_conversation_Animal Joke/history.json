    " Sure! Here's a classic animal joke:\n\nWhy was the donkey elected president?\n\nBecause he was a mule!\n\nThis joke is a play on words, where the word \"mule\" means an animal produced by the crossbreeding of a horse and a donkey. By using the word \"mule\" in this context, the joke implies that the donkey was elected president due to its hardworking and reliable nature, as it was often used for laborious tasks. However, the joke also plays on the double meaning of \"mule\" to create a pun and a humorous outcome."
