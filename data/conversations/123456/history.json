    " is one of the first program that any new programmer learns. It's a simple way of ensuring that the program you're writing is working as it should and can successfully output some text to the console.\n\nFor most languages, \"Hello World\" looks like this:\n\n```\npublic class HelloWorld {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello World\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the above code, the `public class HelloWorld` declares the class. `public static void main(String[] args)` is the main function that runs when the program starts. `System.out.println(\"Hello World\")` outputs the text \"Hello World\" to the console.\n\nIn Python, \"Hello World\" is a bit simpler as it doesn't require a class or a main function:\n\n```\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n``",
    "A classic first program!\n\nIn many programming languages, the first \"Hello, World!\" program is a simple print statement that outputs the string \"Hello, World!\". It's often used as a starting point for beginners to learn the basics of a new language.\n\nHere's an example in Python:\n```\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\nAnd here's one in Java:\n```java\npublic class HelloWorld {\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    System.out.println(\"Hello, World!\");\n  }\n}\n```\nWhat programming language would you like to explore next?"
